# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the code for my multiplayer/ai ultimate tic tac toe game.
In the directory labeled C# there is the my first draft of the code for the ai. I have no doubt that it is riddled with spelling mistakes and generally messy code. This code can also not be run in this format.
In the other directory is my final project, written in OCaml. This code is much nicer (although it too is for from perfect). The majority of the source code is located in the bin directory. You should be able to run the code from the OCaml directory in terminal by writing: dune exec -- ./bin/main.exe
I suggest opening 3 different terminals on one computer to test the multiplayer (for convenience).
